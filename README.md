# About Disney+ Finder

Disney+ Finder is a react app built using [Disney Plus Top Movies and TV Shows API](https://www.allthingsdev.co/apimarketplace/endpoints/disney-plus-top-movies-and-tv-shows-api-by-apirobots/6763fb9e33e2ef7a2c21d7b4), which is an API that provides instant access to a curated list of metadata from a selection of popular titles from Disney+. Making it easier to find the best possible TV Shows and Movies.

## Features

| Home Page | Compare Page | Timeline Page |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| API overview details overview | Compare Title Details | N/A |
| Character Images | Compare Title IMBD Score|  |
| Thumbnails | Compare Title TMBD Score | |
|  | Compare Title TMBD Popularity |  |

## The Idea

The idea was to create a website that you could use to determine which movie or TV show you would like to watch based on their popularity, TMBD and IMBD scores that is available on Disney+.


## Development Process

### Highlights
Highlights of my page are the router navigation bar, doughnut chart created with Chart.js, character images and my dropdown for chosing a title.

### Challenges
A challenge I came across was figuring out [Disney Plus Top Movies and TV Shows API](https://www.allthingsdev.co/apimarketplace/endpoints/disney-plus-top-movies-and-tv-shows-api-by-apirobots/6763fb9e33e2ef7a2c21d7b4) because the endpoint provided by the creator is get random and the get list endpoint did not have discriptive element names for me to call from. So I just removed the get random in the fetch URL link however the issue that still persists is that there are only 10 items in the array.

I was really challenged with the limited usage on the API I had to use 3 different emails, it means I called the API at least 202 times, this led to a delay in developement as i reached out to the creator but did not get an answer.

I struggled with the visiblity of the text in the dropdown, as when a title was selected the font colour would change to black and against the background of the page it is not legible.

Another thing I battled the alert box that pops up on the compare page and how to create it.

A minor challenge I experienced was what data to use that can be visibly distictive in the doughnut chart.

## Future Implementations
